# GenAI-Eshop-Semantic-Kernel

> Practical `GenAI-Eshop` application using [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel), `multi-agent orchestrations`, `Mcps tools`, `A2A Agents`, `Semantic Search` and more.

> **Tip**
> This project is in progress. I add new features over the time. You can check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/mehdihadeli/genai-eshop-semantic-kernel/releases/).

> **Important Note**: We will migrate this GenAI-Eshop application to the [microsoft/agent-framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) instead of [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) in a [sepereated repository](https://github.com/mehdihadeli/genai-eshop). You can check their differences in a practical application here.
